<h1>Block and Inline HTML Elements</h1>

<h2>About the Project</h2>
This is a simple HTML and CSS project showing how HTML block and inline elements behave.

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
While working on this simple project, I learnt the difference between block and inline elements. I also learnt which HTML elements are block elements like <div>, <p>. These elements always appear on a new line and they take up the entire width of the page while the inline elements such as links<a>, spans<span>, images<img> sit on the same line, they do not overflow to a new line except.
